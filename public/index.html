      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h2>by Andy McKerrow</h2>
    <p>I intend to use this app as a platform for writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. After writing the form I used Puppeteer to record myself filling out the form with my own information. Then I pasted the recorded actions into an <span style="color:red">it</span> statement labeled <span style= font-style:italic>'allows entry in all 4 fields and submission'</span>. I ran the test and it passed. </p>
